The code is developed in Rust and consists of three main modules: graph.rs, functions.rs, and main.rs.
To run the code efficiently, please use the following command in the command prompt: cargo run --release

The final report, titled "Analyzing Twitter Networks Final Report", provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, code structure, methodology, and results. 
The report is available in PDF format inside the main zip file. For more information on the project, please refer to the final report.
